    <h1>HOW IS INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATED IN THE COUNTRY INDIA</h1>
<p>On the eve of Independence Day, the president of India delivers an address to the nation from his office that is
broadcast nationally. The main event begins with the hoisting of the national flag by the prime minister, which is
synchronised with 21 honorary gunshots. There are
patriotic parades and pageants, a march-past led by the Indian armed forces. In India,
kite flying is associated with a spirit of freedom and joy. Kite
flying has become a tradition. Kites can be seen soaring high in the sky in the colours of the Indian
flag. A special Beating Retreat ceremony is held at the Wagah Border in Amritsar. It features sword
fighting and cultural dances, the ceremonial closing of gates, a parade and a lowering-of-the-flags ceremony.</p>
